## Mitigations 

## Evidence 
Lab 1.1 consisted of two components, a portable executable (EXE) and a dynamically linked library (dll). By using www.Virustotal.com we can see that the .exe and .dll both set off vendors' virus classifiers. 

By using strings with the .exe file we can see suppose activity. Some keywords that stand out is the last statement says "WARNING_THIS_WILL_DESTROY_YOUR_MACHINE". There is also "c:\windows\system32\kerne132.dll" which replaes the l with a 1.

Dropping it into PeID shows that ijt is a UPX 0.89.6-1.02/1.05-2.90 -> Markus & Laszlo  and
EP Section: UPX1 
  
PEview says that the size of Raw Data is 0  and the virtual size is 400 for UPX0
