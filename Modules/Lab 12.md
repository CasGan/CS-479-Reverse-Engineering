# Detecting DLL Injection 

## 1) Prove that the loader is using DLL injection. (Don't forget a relevant snapshot in Ghidra.)


## 2) Identify the process that will be injected into. Seeing a string in Ghidra isn't sufficient -- explain how the process gets selected.


## 3) Identify the entry point of the DLL injection. Where is DllMain?


## 4) This malware does something every ______ seconds. How often, and where is the loop where that waiting happens?


## 5) What does the malware do every _______ seconds?
