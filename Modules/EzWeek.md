# EZCRACKME1
Running the ezcrackme1 file prompts for a password input. 

The wrong password input will return with: 
  "Your password <pswd input> was incorrect. Time for some more RE ..."
  
To learn more we run the file in strings and went through the ouput. Among the output the string
  "pickklecucumber1337" can be found just above a the string stating "First Password". 
  
  Testing that "picklecucumber1337" as the password we receive the following output: 
  " You cracked me! Now make a keygen!"
