  Running the ezcrackme1 file prompts for a password input.
  To learn more we run the file in strings and went through the ouput. Among the outputs certain strings stand out: strawberry, kiwi, strlen, and strcat.

  It was a succes with "strawberrykiwi". The success output shows as : 
    "You cracked me! Now make a keygen!".
