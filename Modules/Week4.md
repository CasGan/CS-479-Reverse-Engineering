# Week 4 

## Questions 

   ### What is the difference between machine code and assembly?
   Machine code tells the processor what to do with hexadecimal digits known as opcodes. When a high level language is compiled by a program it creates the machine code. 
   Assembly is a human-readable version of the intruction set given to the computer.  
    Assembly langugage tends to be a reliable way to recover from machine code. Since machine code is too difficult to understand assembly is used.

  ###  What is a stack frame?
    
  ###  What would you find in a data section?

  ###  How does `jne` decide whether to jump or not?
    
  ###  What does a `mov` instruction do?

  ###  What is the AL register and how does it relate to EAX?
